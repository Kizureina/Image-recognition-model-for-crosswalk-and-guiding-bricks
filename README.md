# Recognition model of road image for blind people based on transfer learning
This is a machine learning project based on **pytorch**. To imporve the accuracy of the blind guiding system I designed, I utilized the transfer learning MobileNetV2 to train a image recognition model.

This Repository also has the whole dataset. And that dataset includes the crosswalk, guiding bricks and other situation city road images.

The code also includes the data preprocessing and data spliting. Have fun:)
